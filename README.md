01. Crime rates in São Paulo state, Brazil

The aim is to analysie crime tdata in São Paulo state , Brazil.

Data is available at Civil state Police statistics site:  http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/Estatistica/Pesquisa.aspx

Since there is no API or JSON file available in the website, I scrapped data directly and created an entire dataset in Python. I used Selenium library to navigate through the pages and extract data and Pandas library to create dataframes from the scrapped data, including the crime types, year, city and region.

Obs.: Crime Interpretation manual available only in brazilian  portuguese at:  http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/Estatistica/download/manual.pdf

Part 1 - Data extraction via webscrapping with Selenium library (Python), 

Part 2 (to be released soon) - Choropleth maps for states and cities
